# Step 1: Import machine learning tools
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

print("Preparing to train the model...")

# Step 2: Define our inputs (X) and our target (y)
X = data['Review']
y = data['Sentiment']

# Step 3: Split the data
# 80% goes to training, 20% goes to testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 4: Create a Pipeline
# First, we convert text to numbers using TfidfVectorizer
# Then, we use Logistic Regression to classify the sentiment
model = Pipeline([
    ('vectorizer', TfidfVectorizer()),
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression())
])

# Step 5: Train the model on the training data
print("Training in progress...")
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Test the model accuracy
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)

print(f"Model training complete!")
